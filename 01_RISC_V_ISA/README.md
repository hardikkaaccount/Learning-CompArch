# Module 1: The Language of Machinery (RISC-V ISA)

## Introduction

The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is the most important interface in a computer. It is the boundary between hardware and software.

- **Software** (Compilers) assumes the ISA exists to execute commands.
- **Hardware** (Processors) is built specifically to implement the ISA.

In this module, we will demystify this interface using **RISC-V**, the modern, open-source standard.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the philosophy of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer).
2. Master the "State" of the machine (Registers + PC + Memory).
3. Learn the core Core Instruction Formats.
4. Write a program that truly runs on bare metal (simulated).

## Prerequsites

- Basic understanding of binary (0s and 1s).
- Basic C programming (variables, functions, if/else).
