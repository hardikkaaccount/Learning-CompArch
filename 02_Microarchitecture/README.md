# Module 2: The Factory Floor (Microarchitecture)

## Introduction

In Module 1, we learned the "Language" (RISC-V).
Now we look at the "Engine" that speaks it.

**Microarchitecture** is the arrangement of physical logic gates to implement an ISA.
Two different processors (e.g., a tiny embedded chip vs. a supercomputer) can speak the exact same RISC-V language but have vastly different Microarchitectures.

## Learning Objectives

1.  **Pipelining**: Throughput vs Latency.
2.  **Hazards**: What happens when dependencies break the pipeline?
3.  **Memory Hierarchy**: Why RAM is too slow, and how Caches fix it.
4.  **Branch Prediction**: Guessing the future to go fast.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (specifically understanding Instructions).
- Mental model of a "Clock Cycle".
