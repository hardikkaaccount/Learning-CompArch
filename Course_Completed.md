# 🎉 Congratulations! You Have Completed the Roadmap.

## 🎓 Achievement Unlocked: Research Ready

You started with a high-level understanding of AI/ML software.
You have now drilled down to the bedrock of computing.

### 🏆 Skills Acquired

1.  **ISA Fluency**: You speak RISC-V, the language of modern research.
2.  **Microarchitecture**: You understand the "Factory Floor" (Pipelines, Hazards, Caches).
3.  **Bare Metal**: You can control electricity without an Operating System.
4.  **Concurrency**: You know how RTOS schedulers manage time and critical sections.

### 🚀 What's Next?

You are now prepared to speak with your Professor about:

- **Hardware Accelerators for AI**: "How do we map PyTorch layers to a Systolic Array?"
- **Memory-First Design**: "How do we reduce DRAM access energy in Large Language Models?"
- **Custom Instructions**: "Can we add a `GELU` instruction to the RISC-V ISA?"

### 📚 Recommended Next Steps

- **Read**: "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" (Hennessy & Patterson) - _The Bible_.
- **Build**: Implement a UART driver on a physical ESP32-C3 (RISC-V).
- **Simulate**: Try gem5 or FireSim to simulate large multicore systems.
