# Zero to Research: Electronics & Computer Architecture

## Course Syllabus

Welcome to your comprehensive roadmap. We are building your understanding from the ground up.
Each module contains structured reading, visual references, and hands-on labs.

### Module 1: The Language of Machinery (RISC-V ISA)

_Goal: Understand how software talks to hardware._

- **01_Mental_Model.md**: CISC vs RISC, The Translation Layer.
- **02_Registers_and_Memory.md**: The CPU's workspace vs Storage.
- **03_Instruction_Formats.md**: Decoding the binary patterns.
- **04_Lab_Assembly_Basics.md**: Writing your first assembly program.

### Module 2: The Factory Floor (Microarchitecture)

_Goal: Understand how the CPU executes instructions fast._

- **01_Pipeline_Basics.md**: Fetch, Decode, Execute.
- **02_Hazards_and_Stalls.md**: When the factory gets stuck.
- **03_Memory_Hierarchy.md**: Caches, RAM, and Speed.
- **04_Lab_Pipeline_Sim.md**: Visualizing instruction flow.

### Module 3: No Safety Net (Bare Metal Programming)

_Goal: Control hardware directly without an OS._

- **01_Memory_Mapped_IO.md**: Talking to the outside world.
- **02_Interrupts_and_Polling.md**: Handling events.
- **03_The_Boot_Process.md**: What happens when power hits?
